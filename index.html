    <h2>Introduction:</h2>

    <p>Captions and Subtitles have always been helpful to a wide range of users. Whether the user is a 
      student learning a secondary language (L2), or someone who cannot understand the speaker despite understanding the 
      language due to the speaker's accent or pronunciation or if there is any disturbance in the audio, or when the user is someone with hearing impairment, or 
      when the user is in a library or a place which is sound sensitive or in a noisy environment like malls, gathering halls, public transportation, etc. 
    </p>


    <p><strong>Captions</strong> and <strong> Subtitles</strong> are two different concepts. 
      Most people think that the two are the same and can be interchangable.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Captions:</strong> Captions are meant for audience who cannot hear audio. This not only include users with hearing impairements but also 
     users who are in situations where they cannot hear audio like in a noisy environment.
     The primary use of captions is to provide transcription of audio. Caption also includes non-speech elements such as identification of the speaker, 
     sound clues like background noises, music, etc.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Subtitles:</strong> Subtitles are inteneded for a hearing audience. The primary use of subtitles is to provide translation of a video with spoken audio into a language that the user understands.

    <h2>Introduction to Subtitles and Captions</h2>
    <h3> Subtitles </h3>
    <p>Subtitles were first used in the 1930s when the movies started having audio. 
      Subtitles helped accomodate those people who didn't understand the language of the original audio. 
      A type of subtitle known as subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing (SDH) is useful for hearing impaired audience. 
      These are a combination of subtitles and closed captions. They provide users with the features of closed 
      captions like speech and non-speech elements and also provides translations to a language that the user understands.</p>

    <h3>What to Do:</h3>

    <ul class="removeSpaceUL">
      <li>Watch a clip from
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u43NdZpXKg4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the famous television show House Of The Dragon</a>
          <br><br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="removeSpaceP">After watching the video, you will now have some idea as to how subtitles work. This was an example of open subtitle
      meaning the user cannot turn the subtitle off. The clip has dialogues which are spoken in High Valyrian. 
      High Valyrian is a fictional language created by George R. R. Martin for his fictional books. If the video didn't have the subtitles then
      a person who doesn't understand the language would be left clueless as to what was being said. The subtitles helped provide context about 
      what is being said between the two characters for the audience who understands English.</p>
    <br>

    <h3> Closed Captions </h3>
    <p>Closed Captions were first presented in 1971 at a conference for Television for the Hearing Impaired. 
      There are many different types of closed captions. Some of the popular types of closed captions are pop-on, roll-up, and paint-on captions.

    </p>
    <ol>

      <li> Which closed captioning type did you like the most and why?</li>
      <li> Was the first viewing of the video without audio sufficient to understand the content?</li>
      <li> Did the second viewing of the video with the audio increase your understanding of the video?

    <p> <strong>Live Captioning</strong> are a form of closed captioning which are done in realtime. These are used in news, live events, etc.
       Live captioning can be done manually by a stenographer or a voice writer or the captions can be auto generated, but the auto-generated captions are less accurate than captions that 
       are done manually by voice writers and stenographers.
       Auto-generated captions are used on platforms such as YouTube and Zoom in which captions are created using machine learning algorithms and speach recognition technologies.</p>

    <h2>Effects of Captions and Subtitles</h2>
    <p>Captions and subtitles are really useful to a wide range of users and in various situations and scenarios. 
      Captions and subtitles are very helpful to users who are deaf or hard of hearing or those who are in either quiet environments or sound-sensitive environments such as libraries, offices, 
      or classrooms and also in noisy environments such as public transportation, malls, etc. Even though the user may understand the language they might not 
      understand the speaker due to their strong or weak accent, pronunciation, etc. so captions and subtitles can also be very useful to various users in this 
      situation. Overall captions and subtitles increase proficiency and understanding of the content as well as improve comprehension and literacy rates. 
      The goal of this activity is to experience what it is like to watch a video without audio and understanding how captions are beneficial to comprehend the

    <h2>Accuracy of Captions</h2>
    <p> Captions need to be as accurate as possible because deaf and hard of hearing users and many other users
      cannot rely on audio to understand the content of the video. Inaccurate captions are practically no use to a wide range of users 
      in various scenarios (For example: If the user was in a noisy environment) becuase these users will not comprehend the information 
      presented in the video and they may also get the incorrect information.
